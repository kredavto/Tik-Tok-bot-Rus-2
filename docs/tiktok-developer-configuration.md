# TikTok Developer Configuration

## Application Configuration

- Store `TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY` and `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET` only in `.env` or a managed secret store.
- Do not commit TikTok credentials.
- Use separate TikTok developer applications for development, staging, and production when needed.
- Keep `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` synchronized with the production HTTPS callback URL.
- Document every TikTok Developer Portal setting change in the operations journal or admin audit log.

## OAuth Settings

Before release, verify:

- Redirect URI exactly matches `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI`.
- Required scopes are approved in TikTok Developer Portal.
- `video.publish` is approved before production publication is enabled.
- OAuth `state` validation works.
- Access token expiration is handled.
- Refresh token renewal flow works.
- Token refresh errors do not expose tokens in logs.

## Webhook Settings

TikTok webhook configuration must:

- Use HTTPS.
- Match the production public domain.
- Signatures use the TikTok app `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET`; no separate webhook secret is accepted by
  the official verification algorithm.
- Verify the `TikTok-Signature` timestamp and HMAC against the unmodified request body.
- Reject webhook timestamps older than five minutes to limit replay attacks.
- Process events idempotently.
- Log delivery, validation, and processing errors without exposing secrets.

## Production Pre-Release Check

Before every production release:

1. Confirm TikTok Developer Portal app status.
2. Confirm production Redirect URI.
3. Confirm approved scopes.
4. Confirm webhook URL and `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET` signature verification.
5. Run a test OAuth authorization with a test TikTok account.
6. Confirm encrypted token storage.
7. Confirm refresh flow behavior.
8. Confirm official Content Posting API behavior in staging or controlled production test.
9. Confirm no bypass, browser automation, or unofficial API behavior exists.

## Required Direct Post UX

Before every publication the bot must query `/v2/post/publish/creator_info/query/` and:

1. Display the TikTok creator nickname.
2. Require a manual choice from the returned privacy options, with no default.
3. Enforce the creator-specific maximum video duration.
4. Let the user explicitly enable Comment, Duet, and Stitch only when TikTok allows them.
5. Collect commercial-content disclosure and prevent branded content with `SELF_ONLY` visibility.
6. Obtain explicit publication consent before any media is transferred.
7. Poll `/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/` or process final Content Posting webhooks.

Unaudited TikTok clients remain restricted to private posts and other platform limits. The system
must report those restrictions and must not attempt to bypass them.

TikTok account persistence rules are documented in [TikTok Accounts Entity](tiktok-accounts-entity.md).

## Change Control

Changes to TikTok Developer settings must include:

- Date and owner.
- Environment.
- Changed setting.
- Reason for change.
- Expected impact.
- Verification result.
- Rollback plan when applicable.

## Compliance Rule

If TikTok rejects authorization, scope, publication, region, account, policy, or webhook processing, the application must report the restriction and must not attempt circumvention.
